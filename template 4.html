            <div><strong>RE:</strong> <span id="subjectName">Mary Doe</span>; DOB: <span id="subjectDOB">04/08/1981</span></div>

            <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

            <p>It is my understanding that <span id="patientName">Ms. Doe</span>, a <span id="patientAge">43</span>-year-old <span id="bmiClassification">obese</span> <span id="patientGender">female</span>, is a candidate for bariatric
                surgery. It was my pleasure to conduct a presurgical psychological evaluation with this patient
                on <span id="evaluationDate">March 14, 2025</span>. This was a telehealth evaluation and the risks and benefits of telehealth
                were reviewed and consented to by this patient. The evaluation was comprised of a clinical
                interview, including pertinent questions from the Weight and Lifestyle Inventory, as well as the
                administration of a pair of psychological self-report inventories – the Patient Health
                Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7).</p>

            <p><span id="patientName">Ms. Doe</span> was cooperative and friendly throughout the evaluation. Rapport was easily
                established. She seemed alert and was oriented to person, place, date and situation. Her speech
                was normal in rate, rhythm and volume. Her vocabulary and grammatical structure were within
                normal limits. There were no obvious difficulties in receptive language. This patient’s
                autobiographical memory was at least adequate, as she seemed to recall relevant personal history
                without apparent difficulty. Her thought processes were organized and logical. <span id="patientName">Ms. Doe</span>’s
                described her present mood as, “<span id="patientMood">Pretty Good.</span>” Her verbal affect was consistent with this and
                appropriate to the situation. She displayed at least adequate knowledge regarding her pending                
                bariatric surgery and her responsibilities surrounding her surgery that predict a successful post-
                operative outcome.</p>

            <p>The following section regarding this patient’s presenting concerns and relevant history are based
                solely on <span id="patientName">Ms. Doe</span>’s verbal self-report. No other sources of information (e.g. medical records,
                verbal or written reports from other parties) were available, nor were they requested for this
                evaluation.</p>
          
                <p>Ms. Doe states that She is pursuing bariatric surgery for multiple reasons. First, She is
                  dissatisfied with Her current weight of <span id="currentWeight">201 lbs.</span> (BMI = <span id="currentBMI">38.0</span> kg/m2, obese classification, class II)
                  and has struggled to sustain weight loss despite dietary and exercise efforts. She reports first
                  being concerned about her weight about 25 years ago and She has made a number of weight loss
                  attempts since that time, including <span id="previousAttempts">engaging in physical activity, following a low-fat diet, and
                  using over-the-counter weight loss supplements.</span> She is currently prescribed <span id="currentPrescriptions">phentermine and
                  liraglutide for weight management.</span> She denies any history of purging behaviors. <span id="patientName">Ms. Doe</span> notes
                  that the following behavioral and emotional factors have historically contributed to her
                  challenges maintaining a healthy body weight: <span id="weightLossChallenges">overeating at meals/large portion sizes, eating
                  rapidly, overeating when feeling emotionally overwhelmed or down, eating late in the evening,
                  and unhealthy snacking between meals.</span> In addition to weight concerns, she is motivated to
                  pursue surgery due to health issues. <span id="patientGoals">She expressed a desire to improve her overall health and
                  longevity, particularly for the sake of her grandchildren.</span> <span id="previousDiagnosis">She has been diagnosed with sleep
                  apnea, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, and She hopes that weight loss will help her to
                  better manage these conditions. Additionally, She experiences chronic back pain and believes
                  that reducing her weight may alleviate some of her discomfort.</span> <span id="patientName">Ms. Doe</span> also aims to enhance
                  her physical fitness and energy levels. She is confident that bariatric surgery will help her
                  achieve her target weight of <span id="targetWeight">160 lbs.</span> (BMI = <span id="targetBMI">30.2</span> kg/m2, <span id="targetBMIClassification">obese classification, class I</span>).</p>

            <p><span id="patientName">Ms. Doe</span>’s medical history is remarkable for a number of conditions other than morbid obesity.
                As stated above, she has <span id="associatedConditions">chronic back pain, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and sleep apnea</span>. She is satisfied with her sleep quality and quantity. She estimates a typical total sleep
                time of <span id="sleepHours">eight</span> hours a night and feels <span id="sleepStatus">rested</span> during the day. <span id="patientName">Ms. Doe</span> takes the following
                medications: <span id="currentMedications">losartan, phentermine, liraglutide, and fluconazole</span>. <span id="legalDrugUse">She does not use any tobacco
                or cannabis products, nor does she drink any caffeinated beverages. She rarely drinks alcohol.</span>  
                <span id="substanceUsage">She denies use of other substances and has no history of heavy or problematic substance use.</span>
