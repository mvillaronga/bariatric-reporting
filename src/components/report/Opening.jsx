            were reviewed and consented to by this patient.  The evaluation was comprised of a clinical

            administration of a pair of psychological self-report inventories â€“ the Patient Health
            Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7).
